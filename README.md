# [Example WASI proposal]

This template can be used to start a new proposal, which can then be proposed in the WASI Subgroup meetings.

The sections below are recommended. However, every proposal is different, and the community can help you flesh out the proposal, so don't block on having something filled in for each one of them.

Thank you to the W3C Privacy CG for the [inspiration](https://github.com/privacycg/template)!

# [Title]

### Introduction

[The "executive summary" or "abstract". Explain in a few sentences what the goals of the project are, and a brief overview of how the solution works. This should be no more than 1-2 paragraphs.]

### Goals [or Motivating Use Cases, or Scenarios]

[What is the end-user need which this project aims to address?]

### Non-goals

[If there are "adjacent" goals which may appear to be in scope but aren't, enumerate them here. This section may be fleshed out as your design progresses and you encounter necessary technical and other trade-offs.]

### Detailed design discussion

[Short summary of the approach.]

[This section should mostly refer to the .witx.md file that specifies the API. This section is for any discussion of the choices made in the API which don't make sense to document in the spec file itself.]

#### [Tricky design choice #1]

[Talk through the tradeoffs in coming to the specific design point you want to make.]

```
// Illustrated with example code.
```

[This may be an open question, in which case you should link to any active discussion threads.]

#### [Tricky design choice 2]

[etc.]

### Considered alternatives

[This should include as many alternatives as you can, from high level architectural decisions down to alternative naming choices.]

#### [Alternative 1]

[Describe an alternative which was considered, and why you decided against it.]

#### [Alternative 2]

[etc.]

### Stakeholder Feedback

[Summarize feedback from implementers, linking to issues or other posts as necessary].

### References & acknowledgements
